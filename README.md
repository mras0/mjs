# mjs

## Introduction
_mjs_ is an interpreter for [ECMAScript 1st
edition](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%201st%20edition,%20June%201997.pdf)
(a.k.a. Javascript 1997) written in C++17. It was written as a hobby
project for the purpose of gaining a better understanding of how
Javascript actually works. As such, it neither strives to be fast,
secure nor particularly beautiful. In fact, some things are downright
terribly implemented; also no real programs were actually tested.

Most of ES1 should be implemented (to some degree...), but see the
[TODO](TODO.md) file for details. Also be aware that you probably
haven't programmed in ES1 before and will find most modern conveniences
(e.g. array and object literals) missing from the specification.

Support for [ECMAScript 3rd
edition](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%203rd%20edition,%20December%201999.pdf)
is currently (slowly) under way.

## Building

You need a modern C++ compiler that supports C++17 and CMake 3.7 or
later. It has currently been tested with the following compilers:

* Visual C++ 2017 15.8.8 on Windows 10
* GCC 7.1.0 (x64 distribution from [Stephan T. Lavavej](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html)) on Windows 10
* GCC 8.2.0 (on x64 Linux, Debian testing as of October 2018)

To run the tests build the `check` target.

The interpreter is built in the `src` directory. It accepts a Javascript
file on the command line or starts in REPL mode if no argument is given.

These steps should work for most people:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. # Here you may want to use e.g. CXX=g++-8 cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    cmake --build . --target check

## Documentation

The project is currently light on the documentation front, but here is
what's available so far:

* [Implementing a Garbage Collector in C++](https://mras0.github.io/mjs/doc/gc/initial.html) about how the garbage collector was implemented
* [Supporting ECMAScript 3rd Edition](doc/es3/es3.md) on the work being
  done to support ES3 (very incomplete)

## Support

Forget about it :) Feel free to raise an issue on GitHub, but don't
expect anything to come of it.
